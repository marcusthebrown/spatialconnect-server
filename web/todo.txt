We want to push code, then have the entire app deploy...
so we need to build the static assets into the container somehow
....but how do you do that with docker hub's automated builds??
We could create a Dockerfile per environment, and build the static assets data volume container (or a custom nginx container)
***seems easier to use the nginx container than dvc b/c that's one less container dependency


write issue to redeploy the web (static assets) contaner when server container is built
